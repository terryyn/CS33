A:  The conditional test always succeeds because sizeof(val) returns a size_t type which is unsigned number.
    When one of the objects in the operation is unsigned, the result of the operation is implicitly switched
    to unsigned number. The result of conditional test is thus always >=0 and it always succeeds.
B:  if(maxbytes-(int)sizeof(val)>=0)
